/// A widget that displays an image.
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oIAs-0G4mw}
///
/// Several constructors are provided for the various ways that an image can be
/// specified:
///
///  * [Image.new], for obtaining an image from an [ImageProvider].
///  * [Image.asset], for obtaining an image from an [AssetBundle]
///    using a key.
///  * [Image.network], for obtaining an image from a URL.
///  * [Image.file], for obtaining an image from a [File].
///  * [Image.memory], for obtaining an image from a [Uint8List].
///
/// The following image formats are supported: {@macro dart.ui.imageFormats}
///
/// To automatically perform pixel-density-aware asset resolution, specify the
/// image using an [AssetImage] and make sure that a [MaterialApp], [WidgetsApp],
/// or [MediaQuery] widget exists above the [Sprite] widget in the widget tree.
///
/// The image is painted using [paintImage], which describes the meanings of the
/// various fields on this class in more detail.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// The default constructor can be used with any [ImageProvider], such as a
/// [NetworkImage], to display an image from the internet.
///
/// ![An image of an owl displayed by the image widget](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/owl.jpg)
///
/// ```dart
/// const Image(
///   image: NetworkImage('https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/owl.jpg'),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// The [Sprite] Widget also provides several constructors to display different
/// types of images for convenience. In this example, use the [Image.network]
/// constructor to display an image from the internet.
///
/// ![An image of an owl displayed by the image widget using the shortcut constructor](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/owl-2.jpg)
///
/// ```dart
/// Image.network('https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/owl-2.jpg')
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Memory usage
///
/// The image is stored in memory in uncompressed form (so that it can be
/// rendered). Large images will use a lot of memory: a 4K image (3840×2160)
/// will use over 30MB of RAM (assuming 32 bits per pixel).
///
/// This problem is exacerbated by the images being cached in the [ImageCache],
/// so large images can use memory for even longer than they are displayed.
///
/// The [Image.asset], [Image.network], [Image.file], and [Image.memory]
/// constructors allow a custom decode size to be specified through `cacheWidth`
/// and `cacheHeight` parameters. The engine will then decode and store the
/// image at the specified size, instead of the image's natural size.
///
/// This can significantly reduce the memory usage. For example, a 4K image that
/// will be rendered at only 384×216 pixels (one-tenth the horizontal and
/// vertical dimensions) would only use 330KB if those dimensions are specified
/// using the `cacheWidth` and `cacheHeight` parameters, a 100-fold reduction in
/// memory usage.
///
/// ## Custom image providers
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// In this example, a variant of [NetworkImage] is created that passes all the
/// [ImageConfiguration] information (locale, platform, size, etc) to the server
/// using query arguments in the image URL.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/painting/image_provider/image_provider.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Icon], hich shows an image from a font.
///  * [Ink.image], which is the preferred way to show an image in a
///    material application (especially if the image is in a [Material] and will
///    have an [InkWell] on top of it).
///  * [Image](dart-ui/Image-class.html), the class in the [dart:ui] library.

  /// and
  /// [CORS errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors).
  ///
  /// If it's not possible to configure the host, such as when images are hosted
  /// on a CDN or from arbitrary URLs, the app can set the
  /// `webHtmlElementStrategy` parameter of [Image.network] to display the image
  /// in an HTML element, which bypasses the same-origin policy.
  ///
  /// The HTML element is placed in a platform view, and therefore has the
  /// following drawbacks:
  ///
  ///  * Suboptimal performance.
  ///  * Can't be captured by screenshot widgets.
  ///  * The `headers` argument must be null or empty.
  ///  * Some image options are ignored, including [opacity], [colorBlendMode],
  ///    [repeat], filtering, and blurring.

  ///
  /// If the desired asset is specified in the `pubspec.yaml` of the package, it
  /// is bundled automatically with the app. In particular, assets used by the
  /// package itself must be specified in its `pubspec.yaml`.
  ///
  /// A package can also choose to have assets in its 'lib/' folder that are not
  /// specified in its `pubspec.yaml`. In this case for those images to be
  /// bundled, the app has to specify which ones to include. For instance a
  /// package named `fancy_backgrounds` could have:
  ///
  ///     lib/backgrounds/background1.png
  ///     lib/backgrounds/background2.png
  ///     lib/backgrounds/background3.png
  ///
  /// To include, say the first image, the `pubspec.yaml` of the app should
  /// specify it in the assets section:
  ///
  /// ```yaml
  ///   assets:
  ///     - packages/fancy_backgrounds/backgrounds/background1.png
  /// ```
  ///
  /// The `lib/` is implied, so it should not be included in the asset path.

  /// ## Design discussion
  ///
  /// ### Why is the default value of [gaplessPlayback] false?
  ///
  /// Having the default value of [gaplessPlayback] be false helps prevent
  /// situations where stale or misleading information might be presented.
  /// Consider the following case:
  ///
  /// We have constructed a 'Person' widget that displays an avatar [Sprite] of
  /// the currently loaded person along with their name. We could request for a
  /// new person to be loaded into the widget at any time. Suppose we have a
  /// person currently loaded and the widget loads a new person. What happens
  /// if the [Sprite] fails to load?
  ///
  /// * Option A ([gaplessPlayback] = false): The new person's name is coupled
  /// with a blank image.
  ///
  /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
  /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.
  ///
  /// This is why the default value is false. Most of the time, when you change
  /// the image provider you're not just changing the image, you're removing the
  /// old widget and adding a new one and not expecting them to have any
  /// relationship. With [gaplessPlayback] on you might accidentally break this
  /// expectation and re-use the old widget.

  /// VoiceOver on iOS.
